<!-- My Project Features -->

* First 6 rooms are shown dynamically in roms route .
*  If someone clicks on any of the rooms. So he will show him the details of the room.
* If a user booked a room then he can see his edited booking by going to My Booking Route.
* If someone has booked a room then they can give a review, otherwise no one can give a review. But everyone can see the review.
* My booking route is private. A user can view my booking route by logging in, otherwise they cannot view it. Again no one else can see a user's room booking. And if someone makes a room booking, then no one else can make a booking.
* Again if a user cannot delete the booked room on the last day of booking. You can do it the day before.
